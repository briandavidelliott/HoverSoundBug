# Tap Sound Bug

This VisionOS project demonstrates the lack of a system sound when a tap gesture has been added to a 3D entity in a RealityView in contrast to a SwiftUI attachment that will play a system pick sound when the Test button is tapped.

## Description

Here is a screenshot of the immersive view. It does not contain a custom hoover effect and the assumption is that a custom hover effect is not needed because the tap gesture event is invoked successfully.
